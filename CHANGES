Pyramid-Frontend Changelog
==========================

Version 0.4.4
-------------

- Fix an issue where ThumbFilter would fail to process LA-mode images that
  required padding.

Version 0.4.3
-------------

- Switch from autoprefixer command line tool to postcss-cli.
- Clean up Travis CI configuration.
- Fix a bug where images would always be padded with white, instead of the
  image background color.
- Documentation improvements.

Version 0.4
-----------

- Switches to a class-based specification for theme assets. This enables easy
  customization and addition of asset handlers (inside our outside of the
  pyramid_frontend codebase), and makes it easier to configure asset-specific
  settings (e.g. version of lessc executable to use) on the particular asset,
  rather than theme-wide.
- Adds an SVG asset handler, so that SVG files can be tracked in a way similar
  to .less, .js, etc.

Version 0.3.1
-------------

- Allow themes to specify an alternate lessc executable path. This is necessary
  specifically to allow some themes to use Bootstrap 2 and some themes to use
  Bootstrap 3: the two versions use mutually incomaptible versions of the less
  compiler.

Version 0.3
-----------

- Added looking up the URI of a template based on filename, and then using that
  URI to refer to a template that may not be at the end of an inheritance
  chain.
- Fix a bug which prevent using inherited namespaces from an inherited
  template.
- Clean up some Python 3 compatibility mechanisms that may have caused issues
  on certain platforms.

Version 0.2
-----------

- Python 3 compatibility.
- Adopted ``tox`` for testing and static analysis.
- Some documentation improvements.


Version 0.1
-----------

- Initial release.
